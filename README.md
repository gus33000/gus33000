- ðŸ˜„ I own a Dog, named Frei because I was going to get it on a Friday, (but didn't in the end, got it monday instead). This dog was abandonned by the previous owner and now owns 99% of my entire house supply of cushions and sofas. I used to own 2 cats as well, both sadly passed away in 2018. I speak both English and French, and German a little.
